# Awesome adventures 🐈😸💩🤠🐾🐁

# About

There are a lot of adventure and first person shoot-em and violent games in the world.

So I decided to make this "Awesome adventures" text based game, with a twist.
 
**Don't fall into the trap! ... of violence and killing**

That is how this game started to take shape.


# Abstract

The plot of the game is that you are a newborn kitten that is starting to become aware of yourself, from the stage of:

> *Ohh, loooook - I have diz! What are thoze? Hoz diz workz?!*<p>
> *Ohh, I calz diz: Pawzs!*<p>
> **[Tries-Paws-for-the-1st-time]** <p>
> *Mozstly unzstablezs.* <p>
> **[FALLS-DOWN]** <p>
> *... Buzs I canzs makzs workzs!*

What you do next will be up to your imagination and creativity.

# Structure

Most of the code files (.cpp & .h) are placeholders for future development. As it is easer to 1st begin to design a structure and later populate said space.<p>
